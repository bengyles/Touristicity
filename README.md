# Touristicity
Touristicity app

This is a Meteor app (front end only) I made to help a student for their thesis. The idea behind this project was to make an app for a hotel which allows visitors to see all activities they can do around the hotel, restaurants to eat at and much more. 

All this was meant to make the hotel more ecologic by reducing the need to create folders on paper.
